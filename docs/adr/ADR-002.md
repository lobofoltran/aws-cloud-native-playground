# ADR-002: Use Both ECS Fargate and EKS as Compute Platforms

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The AWS Cloud-Native Playground aims to explore **cloud-native compute models** available on AWS, with a focus on **managed services**, operational trade-offs, and platform-level decision making.

AWS offers multiple container execution options, most notably:
- Amazon ECS (with Fargate)
- Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)

In real-world systems, teams often face the decision of choosing between **simplicity and flexibility**, rather than a single universally optimal platform.

---

## Decision

The platform will intentionally use **both ECS Fargate and EKS** as first-class compute options.

Each platform will host workloads that align with its strengths, enabling direct comparison of:
- Operational complexity
- Deployment workflows
- Scaling behavior
- Observability
- Developer experience

---

## Rationale

### Why ECS Fargate

ECS Fargate is chosen to represent the **fully managed container execution model**.

Key reasons:
- No cluster or node management
- Tight AWS integration
- Minimal operational overhead
- Simple scaling model

ECS is well-suited for:
- Stateless APIs
- Background workers
- Simple async consumers
- Teams prioritizing delivery speed

---

### Why EKS

EKS is chosen to represent the **cloud-native orchestration model** based on Kubernetes.

Key reasons:
- Full Kubernetes API and ecosystem
- Advanced networking and traffic control
- Strong observability integrations
- Industry-standard orchestration knowledge

EKS is well-suited for:
- Complex distributed systems
- Advanced autoscaling requirements
- Platform engineering use cases
- Kubernetes-native tooling

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear comparison between managed simplicity and orchestration flexibility
- Practical understanding of when Kubernetes is justified
- Exposure to multiple deployment models
- Platform-level perspective rather than stack dogmatism

### Negative
- Increased conceptual complexity
- Multiple deployment pipelines
- Higher cognitive load compared to a single-platform approach

These downsides are accepted, as the project’s goal is **learning and exploration**, not operational minimalism.

---

## Alternatives Considered

### ECS Only
- Simplifies operations
- Limits exposure to Kubernetes concepts
- Reduces flexibility for complex workloads

### EKS Only
- Increases operational complexity
- Introduces unnecessary overhead for simple services
- Does not reflect real-world platform pragmatism

Both alternatives were rejected in favor of a **comparative, learning-driven approach**.

---

## Scope

This decision applies to:
- All containerized workloads in the platform
- Service placement decisions (ECS vs EKS)
- Deployment and scaling strategies

It does not mandate equal usage of both platforms, only their **intentional coexistence**.

---

## Notes

This ADR reflects a **platform engineering mindset**, where technology choices are guided by context, trade-offs, and operational reality rather than preference or ideology.
